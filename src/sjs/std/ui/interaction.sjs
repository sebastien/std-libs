| Keymaps specify how input events are handled. It is essentially a mapping

| - A special value from `Keymap.SPECIAL`: `CONTROL`, `DIGIT`, `LETTER`, `SYMBOL`, `ANY`
| - The `event.keyCode` number (although this is deprecated)
|
| Here's a more formal description of the declaration of a keymap
|
| ```
| {
|     (<KEY CODE>|<KEY STRING>) : <CALLBACK> | {condition:PREDICATE, action:CALLBACK}
|     â€¥

	@method step event, context, matchingState
	| The @step method is the core of the interaction state machine,
	| as it manages the transitions between state. Each @context state
	| is executed with the current event to determine what the next states
	| are.
	|
	| The *next states* is the list of the states that can potentially happen
	| when an event is triggered. When the `step` is called, each
	| *context state* will be executed in order to generate the list
	| of the *next states* to apply.
	|
	| Each state's `next` property defines what happens after the state, it
	| is meant to return one of more values for the states that might potentially
	| happen.
	|
	| Here is how each value affects the transition:
	|
	| - `True` will *end* the interaction, the `end` state will be added as next
	|   and any remaining states won't be exectued.
	|
	| - `False` will *break* the interaction, skipping any remaining state.
	|
	| - a *string* indicates the name of the next state
	|
	| - an *array* indicates strings|true|false and will be merged with the
	|   current next states.
	|
	| - a *function* is expected to return any of the above
	|
	| - anything else will add `"end"` as the next state.
